# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

As a student in the Full Stack Developer program at UNC Charlotte, I will make many projects that I would like to be able to showcase to potential clients and employers. This portfolio website is intended to be a place I can compile my work and share it with others.

## Installation

## Usage

Navigate to the website. Read the information in the About Me and Contact Me sections as necessary. Click on the cards in the Work section to navigate to the projects in this portfolio. (As of right now, only the first card has a destination while the other two are temporary placeholders.)
